 <h1>Daily Habits for Fitness</h1>
   <h3>Go Outside</h3>
    <p>Take a <strong>walk</strong> walk each day. If you want to take it to the next step try a bike ride. If you are not really an outdoors person, I suggest that you go to the gym or do some yoga. You could also use fitness or yoga videos. If you are a swimmer, you can take a swim at a local pool. Those are just some ideas, and feel free to be as <strong>creative</strong> with exercise as you like!</p>

    <h3> Making a Schedule</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Make reminders on your phone:
             Take a walk or jog either in the morning or in the afternoon</li>
       <li>Track yourself: Time your exercise periods and track how far you went </li>
       <li>Make a goal: work your way up to farther distances</li>
       <li>Indoor version: Use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=fitness+videos">fitness</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=yoga+videos">yoga</a> videos</li>
   </ul>

    <h3> Make <strong>Smart</strong> Goals</h3>
    <p><strong>Smart</strong> goals will help you achieve your level of fitness.<strong> Smart</strong> stands for:</p>
    <ol type="i">
      <li><strong>Specific:</strong> Have acurate numbers of the amounts of distance, and don't change the numbers last minute </li>
      <li><strong>Measurable:</strong> Track your goal and see how you improve</li>
      <li><strong>Attainable:</strong> Make your fitness goal challenging but achievable</li>
      <li><strong>Relevant:</strong> Make sure that is has to do with distace and time. You wouldn't want it to be something other than what you are tring to achieve. Also, make sure it is something you are capable of.</li>
      <li><strong>Time-bound:</strong> Set deadlines, and make sure you don't reach those deadlines without completing your task</li>
